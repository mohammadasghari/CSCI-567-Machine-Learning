# CSCI-567-Machine-Learning 

This repo includes my solutions to the assignments of CSCI-567 Machine Learning course in University of Southern California taught by Prof. Sha.

## Code structure
- `./homework1/`: contains code for the implementation of **linear regression**, **k-nearest neighbors**, and **logistic regression**.
- `./homework2/`: contains code for the implementation of **multi-class classification,**, **multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs)**, and **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**.
- `./homework3/`: contains code for the implementation of **support vector machines (SVM)**. 
- `./homework4/`: contains code for the implementation of **K-means**, **Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)**, and **Naive Bayes**. 
- `./homework5/`: contains code for the implementation of **hidden Markov models (HMMs)**, **PCA** and **t-SNE** for dimensionality reduction.
